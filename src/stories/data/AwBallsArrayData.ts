We’ve influenced the world with our ballroom culture, style, dance and language. Through diverse art forms, a muse (a person, place or thing) sparked an artist to think outside of the box. This made the artists want to create the best!\n\nGMHC was inspired to partner with our community to combine, art, science and creativeness to fight the burden of the HIV and AIDS epidemic which has impacted us, protect life and bring dignity. Through this bond came the inspiration of the House of Latex Ball, and after almost 30 years GMHC has kept their promise of supporting the House and Ball community. \n\nIn the 1920s, the city of Paris inspired Josephine Baker to become not only one of the most famous women in the world during her time, but also to become a larger than life figure; something women of color could only dream of back then. She, in turn, became the muse to Diana Ross and many other black girls and women around the world. Picasso was inspired by his lovers to paint some of the most beautiful and abstract paintings in our history. \n\nIn ballroom, moments create the legends, a single introduction or voguing performance creates an idol, and then the muse is born for those who follow. We all get a little something from somewhere or someone. Who’s your Muse? This year we want you to pay homage to your creative muse and storm the iconic Latex Ball runway. \n\nUnleash your Muse, bring it to life as your inspiration. We should see where your expressive imagination is coming from as soon as you hit the runway. But don’t forget to bring it to our ballroom standards, GRAND!!\n\nFASHION\nBest Dressed (2 Trophies, Male Figure, Female Figure) $150\nOpen To All Labels (2 Trophies, Male Figure, Female Figure) $500\nOpen To All Bizarre (1 trophy) $400\n\nVOGUING \n$10 pot for each, winner wins category pot and the listed amount\nTwisters (1 trophy) $200\nButch Queen Performance (1 trophy) $200\nPop, Dip and Spin (1 trophy) $200\nNew Way (1 trophy) $200\nDrags Performance (1 trophy) $150\nLegendary (1 trophy) $400\nIcon (1 trophy) $400\nFem Queen Performance (1 trophy) $200\nWomen’s Performance (1 trophy) $150\n\nRUNWAY\nDrags Runway (1 trophy) $200\nWomen’s Runway (1 trophy) $200\nFem Queen Runway (1 trophy) $200\nAll American (1 trophy) $200\nButch Queen Runway (1 trophy) $400\nLegendary (1 trophy) $400\n\nTEAM\nTeam Sex Siren (2 trophies, Choose your partner.) $200\nTeam Body (2 trophies, Choose your partner.) $200\nTeam Realness (3 trophies, Make up your Team, can be from another house) $300\nTeam Trans Men: The Ultimate Fantasy Part 2 (2 trophies, Choose your partner and bring on the fantasy, reflect on last year’s Latex Ball.) $200\n\nFACE\nFem Queens Face (1 trophy) $200\nButch Queen Face (1 trophy) $150\nWomen’s Face (1 trophy) $150\nDrags Face (1 trophy) $150",
